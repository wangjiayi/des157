	<h1>Three topic ideas for Diversity</h1>

  <h3>First: material culture diversity</h3>
  <p>The progress of science and technology to a certain extent, is affected by the material culture in human society.Through the investigation and analysis, I found several important aspects of human science and technology progress, such as the promotion of rocket, in aviation technology, energy, nuclear technology, and now the information science.The development and updating of these technologies affect people's living environment and cultural exchange. For example, human production tools: from iron plow cattle farming, hand tools, the development of machine production; from simple machine production to automated assembly line production. From individual, small workshop production development for the factory, the company. In addition, the human means of transport (changes in the mode of transport): from walking, carriage, boat, to the development of a train car and so on.And then, human communication tools (change of contact): from correspondence, telephone, cellphone, internet. All of the above mentioned influences on the diversity of human society.

  <h3>Second: cultural festival diversity</h3>
  <p>For example, in the hearts of the Chinese people, the Mid-Autumn Festival is a family reunion festival, because the day in China's lunar August 15, that day is the moon most round. In our traditional culture, the circle represents a family reunion and unity, so the moon most round is means the family together. This is why the moon cake must be made round. It represents the unity of the family together. In addition, there are Chinese Spring Festival, Lantern Festival. The United States has Thanksgiving, Christmas and so on.

  <h3>Third: national and group culture diversity</h3>
  <p>In China, a total of 56 ethnic groups. Every nation has its own culture and customs. For example, the Han nationality has a traditional Chinese clothing, Hui people do not eat pork. In China, when some festivals are welcomed, family members and friends gather for dinner. Men and women sit together at mealtime to arrange places according to their age. There are thousands of years of China's history, the history of the United States is hundreds of years, and the historical time for forming the society is different. Therefore, the national culture is also different.
