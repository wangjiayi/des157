		<h3>Comparative </h3>
		<p>Culture Diversity Resources is prioritized on the need to embrace its increasing ethnic diversity and assist diverse populations in overcoming barriers to community participation. I like the simple page layout of this site, the color is also very clear, but it does not do well in some aspects, such as its navigation menu is not done well.
		Country Reports provides over 35,000 pages of online content on the cultures and countries of the world. With unique content from around the world. This home page is very simple to do, the overall layout and design is not very good. But the amount of information and data on the page is perfect, and this is where I like it.
		The two websites have completely different styles, which help me to finish my homework differently. All of them are about cultural diversity and have places I can learn from.
