					<h2>Audience Test Result</h2>
					<p>This test is very important. A total of three people tested my website. They gave me a lot of advice. I will make the following changes based on these suggestions.</p>
					<h3>Home page:</h3>
					<p>1: Change the background image, change the size of the title.<br>
					2: Change the overall color, gray is more comfortable than black.<br>
					3: "go left" and "go right" position moved to both sides of blogs.<br>
					4: Delete the text inside the blog, too much.<br>
					5: When you click the blog, can enter the blog page, not only click "read me"<br>
					6: Remove the function of filter and add the function of subscribe. Design time interval to control the time of subscribe appear.<br>
					</p>
					<h3>Blog page</h3>
					<p>1: Change the text content's color and background color, delete text content to show only festival's name, culture and its dates.<br>
					2: Change the position of upload and image div.<br>
					3: Change tag content to festival name, festival date, festival location.<br>
					4: Change the upload part content to "share your own festival photo".<br>
					5: Add back to home page function.</p>
