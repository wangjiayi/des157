			<p>The types of festivals in Europe are very similar to those in North America. There are many different ethnic festivals in Europe, such as the Carnival. The Carnival was a traditional festival back in Europe. The predecessor of the carnival was the English transliteration of the "Carnival" in Europe. It was equivalent to the "Temple" in China. It originated in ancient Egypt and later became a celebration of the ancient Roman god festival. Over the years, the “Carnival” has gradually grown from a traditional festival to a public entertainment event that includes large-scale amusement facilities and supplemented with various forms of cultural and artistic activities. There are numerous carnivals around the world and they have become a symbol of many cities. In addition, Spanish Tomato Festival is a unique Spanish festival. Tomato Festival comes from a purely unexpected. On the last Wednesday in August 1945, a festival parade is being held on the street in the center of Bunyir.</p>
