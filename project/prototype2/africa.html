			<p>There are many ethnic and tribal peoples in Africa, so festivals in Africa are very rich. African festivals have preserved the ancient style. A variety of competitive contest totem worship, and tribal traditional music and dance, are important events in the festival in Africa. In today's festivals, not only the primitive relics of blasphemy and rough are displayed, but also new contents such as promoting national culture, promoting interethnic exchanges and solidarity, and promoting economic trade and tourism development. For example, Festival of Sahara which is held every December in the town of Douz, Tunisia. The festival activities have led the tourists through deserts, samurai and camel parades, camel races, camel fights, etc. Every year, many foreign tourists and local residents share the joy of the festival.</p>
