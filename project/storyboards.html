		<h2>My Storyboard picture 1</h2>
		<p>In my studyboard1, a foreigner came to the United States and never touched Christmas, so he did not know what the festival was. Similarly, when a foreigner comes to China, he has no contact with China's New Year and does not know what the festival is celebrating.When they used my app, they learned a lot about festivals and different national cultures. Then two people of different cultures can become friends after understanding each other's culture.They can also check out my app. Choose their favorite national and cultural festivals and travel together.So with my app, you can check out the major cultural festivals in some countries and learn about the customs of a country.<br><br>
