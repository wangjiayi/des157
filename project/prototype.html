			After the exchange with other classmates, I collected the following opinions. First, the search and favorate features in my blog page can be very difficult to implement. Second, I can strip out the pages for "aboutme" and "contact" separately and merge them into one page. Third, the "blog" in my initial page is superfluous because users can choose the culture they want to know through the following sections. So I will take the above suggestions, remove the home page navigation part, through one button to achieve them. In addition, the navigation part of the home page I can change to an API call, to call the date and tell the user today or in the vicinity of a few days what the festival will coming and the festival took place in which country.
