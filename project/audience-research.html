		<h2>Chinese New Year celebration Audience Research</h2>
		<p>When I wrote this assignment, I just celebrated China's New Year at a primary school in the Bay Area. So when I went to this school celebration, I interviewed some of the parents of children who attended the event, teachers who organized the event, and children who performed the show. The pictures on the left were taken while they were celebrating. By chatting with them I find that although they live in the United States, they celebrate all the important holidays in China. At the same time, because they live in the United States, they also celebrate American holidays. Among those interviewed were Indian, who told me they will also celebrate India's important holidays in the United States. When I asked if they were interested in other international festivals, they all answered in the affirmative.<br><br>

		<h2>Name: Lexi</h2>
		<h2>Age: 6</h2>
		<h2>School: Azevada</h2>
		<p>Lexi was born in New York, USA, and she often goes to China. She likes Chinese festivals very much and she also especially hopes to know more about Chinese festivals. She told me that children in their class are very fond of festivals. During the festivals there are many activities in their schools. They know many very unique ethnic festivals in the world. By chatting with her, I hope I can finish this project very well and have the opportunity to let more children from other ethnic groups in the United States learn about different national cultures and ethnic festivals. And fall in love with various festivals.<br><br>
