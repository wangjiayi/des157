					<h2>Project Brief</h2>
					<h3>Topic Summary:</h3>
					<p> 						
						The theme of this project is the diversity of ethnic festivals. As an important part of national culture, festivals contain characters, mentality, beliefs, ways of thinking and multi-ethnic groups. Different countries and ethnic festivals are also different, they are colorful, distinct, reflecting the local folk customs. Cultural Festival is mainly organized by artists, cultural institutions and local government departments, the state to give some financial support. The rise of modern cultural festival is to revive culture and arouse people's awareness of culture. Today, the world holds thousands of cultural festivals every year. Some carry out a series of activities around an art theme or pass on ethnic beliefs. These festivals provide an important platform for communication between the general public and artists, and help people to establish and share their rich cultural heritage. Therefore, the most important or unique festival of some countries in the east and west is chosen as a festival diversity study. The purpose of the project is to get more people to learn about the diverse cultures of the world through special festivals.
